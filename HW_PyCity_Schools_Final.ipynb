    "\n",
    "* In general, bases on the statistics, the consensus could be viewed as Charter school students outperform District school students. This would be the case without looking deeper into underlying factors.\n",
    "* Student size of a school seems to have a greater determination effect on the overall success of student performance. \n",
    "* Spending per student does not seem to be a factor in determining student success as the District schools spend slightly more per student than charter schools.\n",
    "* More than likely, school size, teacher/student ratios, and curriculum have more determination on school success yet all of those factors are not available here for review.\n",
